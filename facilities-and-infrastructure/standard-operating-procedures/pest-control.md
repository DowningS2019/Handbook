## Procedure

### Facility Design

1. The most effective control is by preventing entry by the appropriate screening of openings and sealing cracks, maintaining the integrity of all surfaces, and eliminating breeding sites.
   1. All areas should be of a design and construction to minimize possible entry of vermin. All racks and openings into the building will be sealed or eliminated, if possible. 
2. In the event of evidence of product being contaminated by vermin, the details of the contamination will be documented and contaminated product will be disposed of.
3. Restricting food consumption to designated areas \(i.e. cafeteria\) will help prevent ants, flies and rodents from being attracted to storage areas.
4. Removal of waste at the end of every day to the dumpster will prevent ants, flies and rodents from being attracted to the building. 
5. Keeping the lids of the dumpster closed will help to prevent wild rodents, squirrels and raccoons.
6. Use of mechanical and physical pest control measures to prevent pest access to the facility. Examples include:
   1. Use of door sweeps on all doors particularly receiving areas, loading docks and exterior doors.
   2. Store product on pallets or shelves that are at least 15 cm from an exterior wall whenever possible.
   3. Limit the time loading/receiving dock doors and exterior doors remain open  upon receiving supplies or with human access.
   4. Situate traps or bait stations near areas of concern such as exterior doors.
   5. Maintain a regular cleaning, sanitation and housekeeping schedule to control pest attraction to the facility.

### Pest Prevention and Control Strategies

1. Building Exterior: Warehouse and Packaging facilities receive passive exterior pest monitoring, each month, through a licensed pest control contractor. The contractor conducts monthly site visits to replace fly traps and ensure all other traps are in working order.
2. Building Interior: Measures include traps for rodents, sticky insect pads and bug light, placed in protected locations near entryways and along walls. Each trap will be dated with the date and room location that it is placed in its location. Traps are checked and documented monthly as part of the pest control contractor site visit.
3. Pesticides should only be used judiciously and when necessary. Licensed pest control contractors will only used pesticides with approval from at least two of the following people: Quality Manager, Health Safety & Environmental Coordinator and/or the Facility Manager.

### Monitoring

1. Document all pest control measures, frequency of application, corrective measures in a pest control log.
2. Inspect all traps monthly.
3. Ensure an up-to-date map indicating location of all pest control devices is kept on site and reviewed annually for accuracy.

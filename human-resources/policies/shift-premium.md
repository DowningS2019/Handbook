# Shift Premium

### Policy

Permanent full-time colleagues who work on the second or third shift are eligible for a shift premium. Shift premiums are in addition to base pay.

Shift premiums are included in the calculation of holiday and vacation pay.

If a colleague is entitled to overtime pay and is in receipt of a shift premium, the overtime payment will include the shift premium.

A colleagueâ€™s supervisor can advise the colleague of any applicable shift premium.

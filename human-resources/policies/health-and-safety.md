# Health & Safety

The health and safety of all colleagues and the protection of the environment is a commitment shared by all colleagues at Edgewell. In order to meet the organizational goal of zero accidents, injuries or incidents, Edgewell recognizes the necessity of active leadership, direct participation and the enthusiastic support of the entire organization. These efforts involve the recognition of control of hazards, the promotion of colleague wellness, and the continuous proactive process of anticipating, identifying, designing, implementing and evaluating risk reduction processes.

Edgewell also meets its commitment to colleagues through ongoing compliance with corporate standards and policies, and federal, provincial and local legislation and program audits. Colleagues are provided with competent supervision, job training, and education so that all colleagues are able to carry out their work according to these established practices and policies.

Colleagues actively participate in the health, safety and environmental programs through various teams in areas such as safety inspections, ergonomics, incident and near miss investigations and early return to work programs.

Colleagues are responsible for following standards and guidelines designed to accomplish their work efficiently and safely. The immediate reporting of incidents, illness or injury to their supervisor is the responsibility of the colleague. Supervisors and managers are to provide this information to the Health, Safety and Environment Affairs Coordinator who is responsible for disability and injury management for all Edgewell colleagues.

To ensure safe performance, all colleagues are to understand and comply with Edgewellâ€™s practices and policies. To perform otherwise may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

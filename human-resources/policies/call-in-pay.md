# Call-in Pay

### Policy

A colleague called in to work during a non-scheduled time \(call-in\) or recalled to work after leaving at the end of their regular shift \(recall\), is eligible for call-in/recall pay at the following rates:

* For four \(4\) hours of work or less, a minimum of four \(4\) hours at the regular rate of pay, or time and one-half for actual hours worked, whichever is greater; â€¢ For more than four \(4\) hours of work, pay at one and one-half for actual hours worked.
* Call-in and recall pay should not be confused with overtime pay which may immediately precede or follow the normal shift.

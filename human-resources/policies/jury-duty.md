# Jury Duty

### Policy

A colleague who is called upon for jury duty or to serve as a witness in a court of law is considered to be on paid authorized leave.

The colleague continues to be paid through Payroll with all usual deductions made. Benefits and pension are administered as though the colleague is actively at work.

The allowance that the colleague receives for services as a juror or witness must be remitted to the Company.

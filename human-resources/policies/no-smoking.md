# No Smoking

Edgewell has an interest in the health of colleagues and in maintaining safe working conditions. For this reason, it is company policy to restrict workplace smoking.

This policy applies to all Company facilities, all colleagues, as well as customers, vendors, and visitors to our facilities. The individual hosting the visitor is responsible for advising the visitor of the Companyâ€™s smoking policy.

Use of smoking materials is prohibited on Company premises, except in designated areas. Colleagues who smoke are responsible for finding out where the designated smoking area is within their location.

Colleagues are required to comply with this policy at all times when on company property and not strictly during their regular workday. A colleague who works late or comes to work on the weekend is still prohibited from smoking on company property.

A colleague who drives a company car and has non-smokers in the vehicle is expected to not smoke should any of the non-smokers object to the smoking.

Each supervisor or manager is responsible for enforcing this policy in their respective area. Disregard for smoking guidelines should be handled through discussions and if unresolved, may lead to disciplinary action.

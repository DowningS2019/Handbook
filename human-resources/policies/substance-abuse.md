# Substance Abuse

### Policy

The purpose of this Policy is to ensure that Edgewell maintains a safe, healthy and productive work environment that is free of illegal drugs, alcohol and marijuana \(unless required for medical purposes\).

Edgewell does not tolerate:

1. The use, possession, distribution, sale, purchase or solicitation of illegal drugs or controlled substances on Edgewell premises or while conducting Edgewell business-related activities off Edgewell premises;
2. The unauthorized use, distribution, sale, purchase or solicitation of alcohol while on Edgewell premises or while conducting business-related activities off Edgewell premises; and/or
3. Being present at work - whether on or off Edgewell premises - under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, marijuana \(unless required for medical purposes\), controlled substances or prescription drugs that impair work performance or a colleague’s judgment.

Any colleague who is found to be in violation of this Substance Abuse Policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment and/or required participation in a substance abuse rehabilitation or treatment program.

Depending upon the circumstances, Edgewell may involve local law enforcement officials, which could result in criminal prosecution in addition to any internal corrective measures.

Colleagues who observe other colleagues under the influence of illegal drugs, marijuana or alcohol should report such conduct immediately to their supervisor or manager. Failure to do so constitutes a violation of this Policy and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### Scope

This Policy covers all Edgewell colleagues \(i.e. full time, part time, temporary, contractors, etc.\). The workplace is not confined to the offices, buildings and work sites of Edgewell. It also includes company vehicles and any location where the business of the Company is being conducted \(e.g. customer locations, off-site business meetings, company social gatherings, etc.\).

Alcoholic beverages may be served at Company business or social functions as authorized by the Company. In such instances, colleagues should use common sense, demonstrate moderation and exercise professional judgment.

### Responsibility

All colleagues are required to report to work in appropriate mental and physical condition, ready to work. The legal use of prescribed drugs or marijuana for medical purposes is permitted on the job only if it does not impair a colleague’s ability to perform the essential functions of the job effectively and in a safe manner that does not endanger themselves or other individuals in the workplace.

Colleagues using prescribed drugs or marijuana for medical purposes that could impair abilities must inform their supervisor or manager immediately about the situation and expected duration of usage. In circumstances where a colleague advises that they have a need-to-use prescription medication \(including marijuana for medical purposes\) that could affect their ability to perform the job, Edgewell reserves the right to request medical documentation from the colleague’s treating physician\(s\) confirming that the colleague can safely perform the essential duties of his or her position and communicating any applicable restrictions and/or limitations that Edgewell ought to be aware of.

Colleagues who suffer from substance abuse, be it with respect to drugs or alcohol, may disclose such conditions to Edgewell without fear of reprisal. Any colleague with a substance abuse problem will be offered the assistance of the Employee Assistance Program \(“EAP”\). In some circumstances, the Company may require an employee to attend a rehabilitation program.

In the event a colleague voluntarily discloses to a supervisor or manager that he or she suffers from substance abuse, or when substance abuse issues interfere with work, it is the responsibility of the supervisor or manager to refer that colleague, on a confidential basis, to either the Department Manager, the Director of Human Resources, and/or the EAP for assistance.

Edgewell will provide a colleague who has a substance abuse problem with reasonable accommodations in accordance with applicable human rights legislation. Time off to attend treatment and/or rehabilitation programs will be strongly encouraged. Colleagues who suffer from substance abuse are expected to make a dedicated and genuine effort to successfully complete treatment and/or rehabilitation programs, and will be given time off \(and/or other reasonable accommodations that may be necessary in the circumstances\) free of penalty provided the colleague participates in and completes such a program. Refusal to participate in or complete a treatment and/or rehabilitation program in cases where Edgewell has determined that it is necessary for the colleague’s continued safe and productive employment will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### Rehabilitation

Edgewell recognizes that alcoholism and drug abuse are treatable diseases and encourages individual rehabilitation efforts. Colleagues who request help from the EAP and/or from other reputable sources in the community may do so without fear of reprisal and, specifically, without jeopardizing their employment. However, volunteering to participate in treatment or rehabilitation programs will not, in and of itself, preclude disciplinary action for violations of this Policy and/or substandard performance.

Edgewell recognizes that harassment can negatively affect morale, motivation and job performance. It is inappropriate, offensive and illegal, and it will not be tolerated in this organization. Harassment in any form – physical, psychological, verbal, written, or electronic – is prohibited.

Every person at an Edgewell workplace is responsible for acting in compliance with this policy.

With respect to any act of harassment, as defined in this policy, Edgewell may, where appropriate: • Discipline any colleague, up to and including termination of employment; or • Report the conduct of any other person to their employer, supervisor and/or principle.

### Responsibilities & Obligations

#### Colleagues

All colleagues, including supervisors and managers, are responsible for following this policy.

If a colleague believes that s/he has experienced or witnessed harassment, it is the colleagues’ responsibility to bring it to the attention of management. Every colleague is responsible for reporting harassment whether or not they are directly involved.

If you are informed by another person that your behavior is unwelcome or offensive, you should listen respectfully to the individual’s concerns and respond appropriately, which may include stopping your behavior immediately. If you are uncertain of what is expected or required of you in response to the individual’s concerns, please contact the Human Resources Director.

If Edgewell conducts an investigation into an allegation of harassment in which you are involved, you will be expected to cooperate. Edgewell will conduct any such investigation fairly and will give any person\(s\) alleged to have engaged in harassment a full opportunity to respond to all allegations before reaching any conclusions.

#### Supervisors & Managers 

All supervisors and managers are responsible for preventing workplace harassment in their work unit\(s\), for treating complaints of harassment seriously and quickly, and for taking appropriate action regarding any form of harassment anywhere in the Company.

All supervisors and managers are responsible for responding to complaints of harassment in accordance with this policy.

#### Human Resources Department

The Human Resources Department is responsible for ensuring that this policy is communicated to all new and existing colleagues and is responsible for any investigations conducted under this policy.

### Reporting Workplace Harassment

Anyone who believes they have experienced or witnessed workplace harassment, should, where comfortable doing so, attempt to resolve the issue through direct communication with the other person\(s\) involved by clearly telling the person\(s\) that his/her/their behavior is unwelcome or offensive and requesting that he/she/they stop immediately.

If a colleague does not feel comfortable dealing directly with the other person\(s\) about his/her/their behavior, or if the behavior continues despite discussions with the other person\(s\) involved, the colleague should then immediately report the behavior and the individual\(s\) involved to his/her supervisor, someone else in management or someone in Human Resources.

If a colleague chooses to file a formal complaint, you will be asked to provide the following information that includes the following: • When and where did the alleged harassment start and when has it reoccurred \(including dates, times, and locations\)? • What happened? What did the other person do? What was your response? • Were there any witnesses? • Where there any threats of reprisal? • Do you have any reason to believe others have experienced similar harassment?

### Investigation of Workplace Harassment

Supervisors and managers are responsible for the climate of their work unit\(s\). When someone in a position of authority is informed about harassment, immediate action must be taken to investigate and resolve the issue. When the supervisor or manager is informed of a complaint, s/he must immediately advise the Human Resources Director. The Human Resources Director will be ultimately responsible for the investigation and for determining how it will be conducted.

If you are in a supervisory or management position and a person complains t you about workplace harassment, you should: 

1. Act promptly;
2. Ascertain if the individual wants to discuss the situation informally or wishes to file a formal complaint of harassment;
3. If the individual wishes to proceed informally and the alleged perpetrator is an Edgewell colleague:
   1. Notify the Human Resources Director immediately and follow the directions of the Human Resources Director;
   2. If so instructed by the Human Resources Director, participate in a meeting or discussion between the complainant and the alleged perpetrator;
4. If the person wishes to proceed informally and the alleged perpetrator is not an Edgewell colleague, notify the Human Resources Director immediately;
5. If the person wishes to make a formal complaint:
   1. Notify the Human Resources Director immediately and follow the instructions of the Human Resources Director;
   2. In consultation with the Human Resources Director, assist in determining whether any immediate action needs to be taken in the workplace pending the outcome of the investigation.

All complaints of harassment or reprisal \(as defined below\) will be promptly investigated by Edgewell. All investigations will be conducted with appropriate care and discretion and will be kept as confidential as possible. However, complete confidentiality is not possible in all circumstances and cannot be guaranteed. For example, disclosure of information about the complaint may be necessary for the purposes of investigating the complaint or taking disciplinary measures.

All investigations will involve a documented interview with the complainant and a documented interview with the alleged perpetrator. The investigator will also interview any other individual\(s\) who may have relevant information to offer and will take any other steps necessary in order to fully and fairly investigate the complaint.

The investigation will be completed and a determination regarding the complaint of harassment will be made and communicated to the complainant and respondent as soon as reasonable practicable. Wherever possible, Edgewell will endeavor to complete its investigation within thirty \(30\) days from the date on which it was made aware of the complaint.

### Results of Investigation 

If it is determined that harassment has occurred contrary to this policy, Edgewell will take effective remedial action commensurate with the circumstances.

Any colleague who is found to have engaged in harassment contrary to this policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

### No Reprisal

Harassment is a matter taken very seriously by Edgewell. Retaliation against any colleague who has made a good faith complaint or participated in the investigation of a complaint or incident of harassment is a violation of this policy. Colleagues who are found to have engaged in retaliation or threats of retaliation will be disciplined up to and including termination of employment.

Retaliation includes: 

* Any act of reprisal that occurs because a person has complained of or provided information about an incident of harassment; 
* Intentionally pressuring a person to ignore or not report an incident of harassment; and
* Intentionally pressuring a person to lie or provide less than full cooperation with an investigation of a complaint or incident of harassment.

A colleague who is found to have deliberately made a false or malicious complaint or has otherwise abused this policy will be disciplined up to and including termination of employment. Such discipline is not a reprisal or breach of this policy.

### Annual Review

This policy will be reviewed at least annually.

## Procedure

### Equipment Selection

Purchase and/or rental of PIV's will be based on Edgewell’s selection criteria. An assessment will be completed to ensure that the equipment will be appropriate in handling certain type of loads and the design consideration of the workplace.

### Facility Design

1. The workplace shall have adequate overhead and side clearances to safely maneuver and operate the PIV's.
2. Floors, aisles and passageways shall be cleared of any clutter, debris and other hazards.
3. Work spaces will be clearly defined with boundary markings separating them from aisles or passageways. 

### Training

1. A PIV operator must have a valid operator’s license prior to the operation of any PIV equipment.
2. It is the operator’s responsibility to ensure their license is valid and to notify their supervisor, manager or HSES Coordinator if their license is suspended, nearing expiry or expired.
3. Each person who operates a PIV shall be trained. Training shall consist of a combination of formal instruction \(e.g. lecture, discussion, interactive computer learning, video tape and written material\), practical training \(demonstrations performed by the trainer and practical exercises performed by the trainee\) and evaluation of the operator’s performance in the workplace.
4. All operator training and evaluation shall be conducted by persons who have the knowledge, training and experience to train Powered Industrial Vehicle operators and evaluate their competence. Trainers shall complete a “train-the-trainer” program or be otherwise qualified/certified to provide PIT training.
5. Affected employees shall receive training to ensure competency for operating each specific type of vehicle they are authorized to drive, including:
   1. Initial training – Operator will be trained on the safe operation of the specific type\(s\) of PIV's they will be required to operate as well as how to operate the vehicle safely in the facility. This training will be conducted prior to PIV use by operator.
   2. At least every three \(3\) years, each authorized PIT operator shall be evaluated for performance and safe operating practices for each type of vehicle they are authorized to operate.
   3. Refresher Training – Refresher training shall be conducted when:
      1. The operator has been observed operating the equipment in an unsafe manner;
      2. The operator has been involved in an incident;
      3. The operator receives an evaluation that indicates he/she has operated the equipment improperly or unsafely;
      4. The operator has been assigned a different type or class of PIV;
      5. A condition in the workplace changes that could affect the safe operation of a PIV;
      6. License is expiring or nearing the three \(3\) year.
6. PIV operators shall be physically and mentally able to safely operate a PIT equipment.
   1. PIV operators shall not have any physical impairment, neurological disorders or other health disorders that can affect the safe operation of the lift truck and must have sufficient physical ability, endurance, agility, and coordination to meet the demands of the job, which can include movement of the neck, upper and lower limbs, and trunk.
   2. PIV operators must have visual acuity necessary for the job to view all signs, instruction, and labels, able to differentiate between colours and must have good peripheral vision, judgement of space, including depth, height and distance.
   3. PIV operators must be able hear warning signals such as the use of horns or emergency alarms
   4. The employee may be required to provide an assessment of functional abilities from their physician to verify their ability to safely operate a PIV equipment. This may include a vision and hearing test and a physical medical examination.
   5. PIV operators shall not operate the equipment while taking medications that could adversely affect vision, perception, or any mental or physical abilities necessary for the safe operation of the equipment.
      1. PIV Operators that may, due to their medical condition, take medication and in the opinion of the employer or treating physician may place their safety or the safety of others in jeopardy, will not be permitted to operate a PIT equipment. The PIT operator must provide a medical certificate outlining their assessment of functional abilities to return to work and to operate an equipment prior to returning to work.
7. Safety shoes are required to be worn by all PIV Operators. Safety shoes must be steel-toed, non-slip and CSA approved. Additional personal protective equipment requirements will be based on specific jobs and hazard assessment.

### Inspections & Maintenance

1. Daily Pre-Operational Inspection checklist must be completed on each shift prior to the use of each PIV.
2. Quarterly preventive maintenance is conducted by a certified and qualified contractor to ensure the PIV is in a good and safe working condition.
3. An annual lifting device inspection is performed by a certified and qualified contractor to identify any deficiencies and for the load-handling capability to be assessed.
4. Any deficiencies identified shall be brought to the attention of Department Leads, Supervisor/Manager or the HSES Coordinator prior to the operation of the equipment.
5. PIV's shall have their battery charged in the designated battery charging stations.
6. Maintenance of the battery must be conducted weekly at the beginning of the work week. This is accomplished by adding water to the battery through a closed loop watering system. The closed loop watering system eliminates any associated battery hazard such as acid splash.

### General Operating Requirements

1. This SOP shall be followed in conjunction with the training provided by the qualified and licensed Powered Industrial Vehicle training provider.
2. Only a licensed operator shall operate the PIV. The PIV will be operated safely following the manufacturer’s instructions and will be utilize only by the manufacturer’s intended purpose.
3. A Pre-Operational Inspection Checklist must be completed for each shift prior to the use of equipment
4. The PIV operator must wear seat belts if the PIV is equipped with them.
5. The PIV equipment shall not be used to lift any person unless it has an approved safety platform per the CSA standard. The person must wear an approved fall restraint system and be tied off always while in the platform. 
6. The PIV equipment shall not be used to carry passengers. Only one person to operate the equipment.
7. No person shall stand or walk under elevated forks, with or without load.
8. The forks must be lowered to the ground and power shut off when leaving the vicinity of the PIV.
9. The operator may be required to leave the operating position with the forks up to perform or enhance certain functions and tasks such as:
   1. Viewing the placement of a load;
   2. Determining the location of the forks relative to the pallet entry;
   3. Picking or placing components of the load.
   4. When the PIV operator is required to leave the operator’s position to perform the above tasks, the operator shall:
      1. Return all controls to neutral;
      2. Apply the parking brake;
      3. Return the key-switch to the OFF position; and
      4. Remain in the immediate vicinity \(approximately one truck length or 5 Feet\) and in full view of the lift truck and its load.
10. The keys in the PIV shall not be left unattended. The PIV operator is responsible for their own keys.
11. The PIV operator must stay inside the PIV while in operation. Do not jump off the PIV while it is still in motion.
12. Never reach through the mast.
13. PIV operators must slow down and sound the horn at intersections, blind spots and when pedestrians are present. PIV's equipped with warning lights \(reversing lights\) must be in good working condition. PIV operators must also use the overhead mirrors when available in all intersections.
14. The PIV operator shall look on all direction of travel and keep clear view of the path of travel. The operator must operate in reverse if the load obstructs the line of vision in any way.
15. PIV operators shall ensure that the PIV and load has sufficient overhead clearance from lights, pipes, fans, etc.
16. PIV operators shall slow down and utilize extra caution on wet and/or slippery conditions.
17. Load rating of the PIV is identified and inscribed in the plate attached to the unit. Do not use PIV without the load rating.
18. Before lifting and moving, ensure the load is centered and stable. If load cannot be centered, proceed with caution and move slowly.
19. Pallets that are broken must have the loads transferred to another pallet prior to moving the load when feasible and safe to do so.
20. Loads shall be carried as low as possible to the ground unless necessary to clear obstacles on the floor.
21. A person must not ride on top of the load that is being moved.
22. PIV operators may only enter the trailer when the trailer restraint system lighting is ‘green’.
23. When unloading a trailer that is not attached by a dock restraint system, it is necessary that two jacks be used, and two trailer wheels must be chocked. The two jacks are in addition to the truck’s landing gear. The chocks are necessary to prevent horizontal movement and the jacks are intended to prevent vertical movement or tipping if the trailer’s “landing gear” collapses. Trailers that have the truck attached must have two wheels chocked if not locked into the dock restraint system. The forklift operator who will be unloading the trailer is responsible for ensuring that this equipment is in place prior to unloading the trailer.
